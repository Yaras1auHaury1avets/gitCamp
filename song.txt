[Verse 1]
Today I'm dirty, I want to be pretty
Tomorrow, I know I'm just dirt
Today I'm dirty, I want to be pretty
Tomorrow, I know I'm just dirt

[Chorus]
We're the nobodies, wanna be somebodies
We're dead, they'll know just who we are
We're the nobodies, wanna be somebodies
We're dead, they'll know just who we are

[Verse 2]
Yesterday I was dirty, wanted to be pretty
I know now that I'm forever dirt
Yesterday I was dirty, wanted to be pretty
I know now that I'm forever dirt

[Chorus]
We're the nobodies, wanna be somebodies
We're dead, they'll know just who we are
We're the nobodies, wanna be somebodies
We're dead, they'll know just who we are

[Bridge]
Some children died the other day
We fed machines and then we prayed
Puked up and down in morbid faith
You should have seen the ratings that day
Some children died the other day
We fed machines and then we prayed
Puked up and down in morbid faith
You should have seen the ratings that day
