[Verse 1]
Today I'm dirty, I want to be pretty
Tomorrow, I know I'm just dirt
Today I'm dirty, I want to be pretty
Tomorrow, I know I'm just dirt

[Chorus]
We're the nobodies, wanna be somebodies
We're dead, they'll know just who we are
We're the nobodies, wanna be somebodies
We're dead, they'll know just who we are
